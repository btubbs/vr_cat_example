This Heroku- and Velociraptor-compatible app is to be used for testing
deployment tooling.  The app defines only one proc, called 'cat', which does
nothing but start the Unix utility 'cat'.  Since it is passed no filenames it
will wait for input on stdin until it is stopped.

This app also contains a hello.txt file, which makes it compatible with the
"hello" buildpack at https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-hello.
